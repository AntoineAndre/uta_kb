## Parts

Here are the different parts used for this macro pad:

- [ ] 1x Arduino Pro Micro (Atmega32u4)
- [ ] 1x rotary encoder
- [ ] 3x mechanical switches
- [ ] 3x keycaps
- [ ] 1x L-shaped 2 mm thick aluminium plate (top and front)
- [ ] 1x 2 mm thick aluminium plate (bottom)
- [ ] 3x 4 mm thick aluminium plate (left, right and back)
- [ ] 6x M2 screws

## Case build

The case is build with above mentionned parts, in aluminium. It is important to note that the top plate is to be cut with square holes, so stay patient when doing this.

The right side of the case needs to be cut a little, in order to let the micro USB cable connect to the Arduino Pro Micro.

The holes of the left, right and back plate (with the 4mm wide aluminium plates) size 1.7 mm in diameter. A M2 threading tool is used to make the screws fix the assembly.

The bottom plate is fixed with cyanolite glue to the left, right and back plates. This way the keyboard is still unmoutable by removing the top and front parts (that are attached together since a L-shaped plate is used).

Make sure to add some isolant (electric tape for example) and fill the inside of the case so that there isn't any short-circuit (since the case is all in aluminium).

The plan of the assembly is made as follow:
